# Object Detection Using Convoutional neural Network 

In this tutorial I will go through the setup environement , data set creation and the Developement of an object detectection/recognition Application. 
We will you the algorithm "you look only once" abriviyated also YOLO  

## Demo

[!Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8_RptRGrDw&feature=youtu.be)

##  goals

Be able to detect many objects in the same image and in real time. 

##  materiels

### Hardware

* Packard Bell easy note Pc running Windows 10. 
* CPU  =  2.5 hz
* RAM  = 4GB 
* HDD  = 500 GB 

### Sotware

- `python3` as programming language

- `opencv` the open computer vision library  so we can play around our cams

- `tensorflow` Deep Learning Framework 

- `keras` API that interfaces tensorflow

## Installation

### Download github repository

```shell
https://github.com/deepKratos/objects-detection.git
```

### Create virtual environement

- Windows users

```shell
python -m venv myenv # creates a virtual environement
cd myenv\Scripts # change folder
.\activate # activate environement
```

- Linux users

```shell
python -m venv myenv # creates a virtual environement 
cd myenv\bin # change folder
source activate # activate environement  
```

### Prepare environement / Install dependencies

```shell
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Run the code

To execute the code:

`TODO`

## I'll open Source it as soon i finish with the android app . Keep in touch
